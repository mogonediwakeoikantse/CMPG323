# CMPG323 Project-3 32494122 

### Welcome to project 3 of CMPG323. This project is a WebApp built on Microsoft Visual Studios.

### Description

Project 3 is a WebApp built on Microsoft Visual Studios. The WebApp makes use of a cloud database to store data that is entered by a user. A user can manipulate the data on the website using the different functionalities that are provided. Some of these functionalities are the standard CRUD operations. CRUD is basically an acronym which basically describes the four basic operations a program should be able to perform. In this WebApp, A repository pattern is used as implementation for the different functionalities.

### Repository Pattern 
A repository is basically a design pattern which is integrated as an additional layer between the WebApp and the database. The diagram below provides an overview of what this pattern is.
