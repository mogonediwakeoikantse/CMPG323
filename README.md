## Welcome to CMPG323 Project 3.
#### Introduction
Project 3 is a WebApp solution that has been built through Microsoft Visual Studios. The database for this project will be hosted on Azure. 

#### Repository pattern
For this project, I have selected to implement Tier 2 repository pattern. Basically, the controllers are seperated into seperate repositories. This is because if a change needs to be made in a specific controller, it would be convenient to only make the change in that specific controller repository.
